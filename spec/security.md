## Security Requirements

Key Questions

1. Does the honest network converge in the presence of forks
2. Can an attacker gain an advantage through private simulation of different solutions?
3. Is there an incentive for nodes to gossip/solve ahead of the deadline (and simulate)?
4. What is the probability of winning by encoding on-demand?
5. How far back may a history rewriting attack be implemented?
6. Are there any incentives for selfish mining?
7. Is pooled mining even possible?
8. How ASIC resistant is Sloth?
9. Shortcuts in Sloth computation?
10. Do incentives work correclty for the plotting pieces closest to node_id?
11. Is there any advantage to employing the sybil attack (using multpile node ids)?
12. Does the g-greedy strategy allow for the balance attack?

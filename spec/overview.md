## Subspace Ledger Specificaiton

The spec is currently broken into four parts:

1. [Protocol](protocol.md) describes the basics of network consensus for the Subspace Network Ledger.
2. [Security](security.md) analyzes and accounts for consensus related security vulnerabilites.
3. [Architecture](architecture.md) provides a high level overview of the reference implementation in Rust.
4. [Competitors](competitors.md) compares and contrasts Subspace with other proof-of-space/storage networks.

Later this will include

* Subspace Improvement Proposals (SIP) List
* Client Implementations
* Layer II network
